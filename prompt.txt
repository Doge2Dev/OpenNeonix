I want take a array formated like this:

map = {
    0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
    0, 2, 0, 0, 0,
    0, 0, 1, 1, 0,
    0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
    0, 0, 0, 0, 3,
}

and I need an array that looks like this:

map = {
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 2, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 1, 1, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 3},
}
